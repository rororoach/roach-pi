## What is ROACH PI?

ROACH PI is an extension suite for the pi coding agent. It turns a normal coding session into a disciplined engineering loop:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/workflow-preview.svg" alt="ROACH PI workflow: clarify → plan → worker → validator" width="88%">
</p>

It is intentionally inspectable: commands, tools, hooks, agents, and skills are plain TypeScript and Markdown in this repository.

---

## Architecture

Seven bundled extensions, one disciplined engineering loop:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture-overview.svg" alt="ROACH PI extension architecture overview" width="88%">
</p>

---

## Installation

```bash
pi install git:github.com/tmdgusya/roach-pi
```

Restart `pi`, then run setup once:

```bash
/setup
```

`/setup` writes `quietStartup: true` to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` so ROACH PI can own the startup banner instead of duplicating pi's default extension listing.

> [!WARNING]
> If you have the `superpowers` skill installed, remove it before using ROACH PI. It can define skill names that collide with this extension's bundled skills, and pi does not guarantee extension override order for duplicate skills.

---

## Quick Start

Try the disciplined path on a real task — from fuzzy idea to verified implementation in minutes:

```text
/clarify Add a feature that exports review results as Markdown
```

After the context brief is clear:

```text
/plan
```

Then ask the agent to run the plan through the execution loop:

```text
plan-compliance → plan-worker → plan-validator
```

Before merging non-trivial changes, run a review:

```text
/ultrareview
```

Quick system checks for visibility:

```text
/fff-health
/lsp status
/memory stats
```

---

## Clarify and Plan

Vague requests should not become vague code.

**`/clarify`** forces ambiguity into the open before implementation starts. It asks one focused question, offers concrete choices when useful, and explores relevant files with an `explorer` subagent in parallel.

The output is a **Context Brief** — a structured summary of the clarified scope, constraints, and affected files.

**`/plan`** then converts that brief into a task-by-task implementation plan with:
- explicit files to modify
- step-by-step instructions
- verification commands
- success criteria

Plan execution uses a **compliance → worker → validator** loop, so implementation and verification stay separated. Structured progress tracking records milestones, plan tasks, and todos as durable state — the footer reflects live `running` → `completed`/`failed` transitions and can restore progress from session replay.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/clarify [topic]` | Resolve ambiguity with dynamic questions and parallel exploration |
| `/plan [topic]` | Create an executable implementation plan |
| `/plan --milestones [topic]` | Break complex work into milestones using three planning reviewers |
| `/reset-phase` | Clear active clarify/plan state |

---

## Subagent Orchestration

The `subagent` tool delegates work to specialized agents running as separate `pi` processes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/subagent-modes.svg" alt="ROACH PI subagent modes: single, parallel, chain, async" width="88%">
</p>

Supported modes:

| Mode | Use it for |
|---|---|
| **Single** | One focused investigation or execution task |
| **Parallel** | Independent reviewers, explorers, or workers |
| **Chain** | Sequential pipelines where each step consumes the previous output |
| **Async** | Background tasks that can be waited on, checked, or interrupted by run id |

Async subagents support `asyncDependency: "needed-before-final"` when the lead agent must join results before finalizing its response.

---

## Review Pipelines

Two levels of review, one unified goal: catch problems before they ship.

**`/review`** — quick integrated review of a PR, branch, or local diff.

**`/ultrareview`** — the deep pass:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/review-search-preview.svg" alt="ROACH PI ultrareview pipeline: 10 reviewers → verifier → synthesis" width="88%">
</p>

1. resolve the diff once
2. dispatch 10 reviewers in parallel
3. run `reviewer-verifier` to dedupe and filter false positives
4. run `review-synthesis`
5. save the final report under `docs/engineering-discipline/reviews/`

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/review [target]` | Quick single-pass review. Target can be omitted, PR number, PR URL, or branch |
| `/ultrareview [target]` | Deep 10-reviewer pipeline with verifier and synthesis report |

---

## FFF Search

The bundled FFF extension upgrades pi's file and content search with git-aware ranking and frecency.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fff-search-preview.svg" alt="ROACH PI FFF search: find, grep, multi_grep, @ autocomplete" width="88%">
</p>

- **`find`** — fuzzy file name search with frecency and git-aware ranking
- **`grep`** — content search with pagination and smart-case behavior
- **`multi_grep`** — multi-pattern OR search in one pass
- **`@` autocomplete** — replace pi's default file picker with FFF suggestions (toggle with `/fff-mode both`)

FFF is fallback-safe: if the native engine is unavailable, tools gracefully degrade to pi's default search.

---

## LSP Code Intelligence

The bundled `pi-lsp-client` extension adds IDE-like operations directly inside pi sessions:

- `lsp_diagnostics` — errors, warnings, and hints
- `lsp_goto_definition` — jump to symbol definitions
- `lsp_find_references` — find all usages across the workspace
- `lsp_symbols` — document and workspace symbol search
- `lsp_prepare_rename` — check if a rename is safe
- `lsp_rename` — rename a symbol across the entire workspace

Supports **40+ language server configs** out of the box.

```text
/lsp              Open the LSP server inspector
/lsp status       Print installed/available language server summary
/lsp install <id> Run a whitelisted install recipe
/lsp warmup <id>  Preload a language server for the workspace
```

---

## MCP Adapter

The bundled [pi-mcp-adapter](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter) extension gives pi access to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers without burning the context window. Instead of registering hundreds of tool definitions upfront, a single proxy tool (~200 tokens) discovers and calls MCP tools on-demand.

```text
mcp({ search: "screenshot" })              # discover tools by keyword
mcp({ tool: "chrome_devtools_take_screenshot", args: '{"format": "png"}' })  # call a tool
```

Servers are **lazy by default** — they only connect when you actually use their tools, and disconnect after idle timeout. Specific tools can be promoted to first-class Pi tools via `directTools` config.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/mcp` | Interactive server panel with connection status and tool toggles |
| `/mcp setup` | Guided first-run setup (import existing configs, scaffold `.mcp.json`) |
| `/mcp tools` | List all available MCP tools |
| `/mcp reconnect [server]` | Connect or reconnect a server |
| `/mcp logout <server>` | Clear stored OAuth credentials |
| `/mcp-auth [server]` | OAuth authentication flow |

Configuration reads standard MCP files automatically: `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`, `.mcp.json`, or Pi-specific overrides in `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`.

---

## Workspace Memory

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/lsp-memory-preview.svg" alt="ROACH PI LSP tools and workspace memory save/recall flow" width="88%">
</p>

Workspace memory stores important findings as structured records under pi's agent directory, scoped by workspace. It recalls relevant records into future sessions automatically.

```text
/memory list           List all memories
/memory show <id>      Show a specific memory
/memory save <text>    Save a new memory
/memory delete <id>    Delete a memory
/memory search <query> Search memories
/memory stats          Show memory statistics
```

The LLM-callable `memory_save` tool is used after bug fixes, decisions, or useful discoveries — so the agent avoids repeating the same fixes.

---

## Session Loop

**`/loop`** schedules recurring prompts inside the current session — useful for health checks, monitoring, or continuous verification:

```text
/loop 5m check git status and report changes
/loop 30s verify the dev server is running on port 3000
```

Jobs are session-scoped, error-isolated, timeout-protected, and cleaned up on shutdown.

```text
/loop-list           List active loop jobs
/loop-stop [job-id]  Stop one loop job
/loop-stop-all       Stop all loop jobs
```

---


---

## Nested `AGENTS.md`

The bundled nested-agents extension injects nearby directory-level `AGENTS.md` files whenever the agent reads a file. This lets each subtree carry local conventions without forcing you to paste them into every prompt.

```text
/nested-agents           Toggle the nested AGENTS.md context widget
pi --no-nested-agents    Disable at startup
```

---

## Configuration

### Recommended Startup

```jsonc
// ~/.pi/agent/settings.json
{
  "quietStartup": true
}
```

`/setup` writes this for you.

### FFF Search Mode

```bash
PI_FFF_MODE=both pi          # tools + @ autocomplete
PI_FFF_MODE=tools-only pi    # tools only
```

Or change it live:

```text
/fff-mode both
/fff-mode tools-only
```

### Team Mode

```bash
PI_ENABLE_TEAM_MODE=1 pi
```

Disabled by default. Exposes the `team` tool and makes `/team` functional.


### Sandboxed Bash Approval

```bash
PI_SANDBOX_APPROVAL_MODE=ask pi      # ask before escalation
PI_SANDBOX_APPROVAL_MODE=always pi   # approve automatically
PI_SANDBOX_APPROVAL_MODE=deny pi     # block escalation
```

### LSP Configuration

Create project-local `.pi/lsp-client.json` or user-global `~/.pi/lsp-client.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "lsp": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": ["my-lsp", "--stdio"],
      "extensions": [".myext"]
    }
  }
}
```

Bundled package dependencies also include `pi-lsp-client`, `pi-mcp-adapter`, and `@code-yeongyu/pi-nested-agents-md`.

---

## Development

Install dependencies in the extension you are changing, then run that extension's tests and type checks:

```bash
npm --prefix extensions/agentic-harness install
npm --prefix extensions/agentic-harness test
npm --prefix extensions/agentic-harness run build
```

For a broader local sweep, repeat the same pattern per extension:

```bash
npm --prefix extensions/agentic-harness test && npm --prefix extensions/agentic-harness run build
npm --prefix extensions/fff-search test && npm --prefix extensions/fff-search run build
npm --prefix extensions/session-loop test && npm --prefix extensions/session-loop run build
npm --prefix extensions/workspace-memory test && npm --prefix extensions/workspace-memory run build
```

There is no root `npm test` script in `package.json`; use the extension-level commands above.
